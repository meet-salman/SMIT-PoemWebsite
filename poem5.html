    <p class="poem">
        You are proud as a master poet, <br>
        Poetic soul with rhythmical intellect, <br>
        Verse and prose comes from you imaginative wit, <br>
        Be laud with a prolific languages steal our spirit. <br><br>

        One sadden moment I read your poetry,       <br>
        Deep with significant messages, got pity with my vocabulary,        <br>
        What a wonderful legendary poem story created beautifully.      <br>
        Bravo, hooray! , , , it hooked my heart amazingly,      <br><br>

        A mail links popped-up on my search out of the blue,        <br>
        Seeing with my two eyes rolling and open wide, no it can't be,      <br>
        Copy paste poetry? ? ? Can't call it your own piece,        <br>
        Not a genuine poet; with false charade and intelligence.        <br><br>
           
        Copy paste poetry lines from the internet search out,       <br>
        Words are flowery so as lines are always with doubt,        <br>
        Lies behind the copy paste poems, it gains distrust,        <br>
        Craft your poem with honesty and integrity, please do my dear poet.     <br><br><br>
